# Image-Data-Augmentation-with-Keras

Data augmentation is a technique used to create more examples, artiÔ¨Åcially, from an existing dataset. This is useful if the dataset is small and we want to increase the number of examples. Data augmentation can often solve over-fitting so that our model generalizes well after training. For images, a variety of augmentation can be applied to increase the number of examples. Check: https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html- for more about this technique.
